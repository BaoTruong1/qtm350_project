# qtm350_project
This is the final project for QTM 350 class. Our group chooses to work on the topic of economic development. In this project, we use data from World Bank to analyze and visualize the relationship between GDP per capita, Employment to population ratio, and GDP growth of the North America region. Our research question is: "Does having a higher employment ratio and ppp correlates with higher gdp growth."
